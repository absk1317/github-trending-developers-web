This project renders trending developers in any coding language in three different periods, namely daily, weekly and monthly.

#### The Project is written with help of React 16.12.0, and Redux 4

#### There is no concept of local state anywhere, and redux has been utilized to its fullest.

#### Have used locales file for easy localization, if desired.

#### Styles are put up in separate files, in the same heirarchy as the component file, we haven't used inline styles anywhere.

#### All requests to port 3001 with /api have been proxied, and won't be handled by react.

#### We have used MVC patter for meeting our requirements.
  Reducers are models,
  Actions are controller actions, and,
  Views as views
